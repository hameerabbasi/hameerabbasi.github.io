<p>
    I'm currently a Master student at <a href="https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/">TU Darmstadt</a>. I've held numerous HiWi
    (TA/RA for Americans) positions, and I'm currently hold a HiWi position at the <a
        href="http://www.bcs.tu-darmstadt.de/biocomm/welcome/index.en.jsp">Bioinspired Communication Systems</a>  group.
    In the past, I've worked at <a href="http://www.lmkr.com/">LMKR</a> as a research engineer, as a major part of the
    development and research for <a href="http://www.lmkr.com/gverse/gverse-attributes/">GVERSE Attributes</a>, an
    application that makes use of Nvidia CUDA to compute and render seismic attributes in real time.

    In my free time, I work on <a href="https://github.com/pydata/sparse/">sparse</a>, a Python library providing
    multidimensional sparse arrays compatible with Numpy.
