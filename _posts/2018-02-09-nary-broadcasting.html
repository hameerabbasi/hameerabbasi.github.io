title: N-ary Broadcasting in Sparse
layout: post
---

<p>So far, broadcasting in <a href="https://sparse.pydata.org">Sparse</a> has been limited to two operands. This
    weekend,
    I'll be working on N-ary broadcasting, which will help in implementing the <a
            href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.where.html">three-argument version of
        <code>numpy.where</code></a>.</p>

<p>This is one of the features needed for <a href="http://xarray.pydata.org/">XArray</a> integration (see <a
        href="https://github.com/pydata/sparse/issues/1">this GitHub issue</a>). Coming up after that:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Arbitrary fill-values.</li>
    <li><code>NaN</code>-skipping aggregations</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Update (18 Feb):</strong> It seems that N-ary broadcasting is now in a fairly stable state and will land soon. Follow
    the discussion over at <a href="https://github.com/pydata/sparse/pull/98">this pull request</a> for progress. I'm
    sorry for the delay compared to what I may have originally implied earlier, but this was a much more complex problem
    than what I had originally envisioned and I only work on this project on weekends in my free time.</p>
