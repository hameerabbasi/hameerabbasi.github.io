title: N-ary Broadcasting in Sparse
layout: post
---

So far, broadcasting in <a href="https://sparse.pydata.org">Sparse</a> has been limited to two operands. This weekend,
I'll be working on N-ary broadcasting, which will help in implementing the <a
        href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.where.html">three-argument version of <code>numpy.where</code></a>.

This is one of the features needed for <a href="http://xarray.pydata.org/">XArray</a> integration (see <a
        href="https://github.com/pydata/sparse/issues/1">this GitHub issue</a>). Coming up after that:

<ul>
    <li>Arbitrary fill-values.</li>
    <li><code>NaN</code>-skipping aggregations</li>
</ul>
