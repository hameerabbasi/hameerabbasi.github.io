title: Introducing Sparse
layout: post

<p>The state of sparse arrays in Python isn't exactly the finest. The current best library is <a
        href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/sparse.html"><code>scipy.sparse</code></a>, but it has some
    poor design decisions that make it less than optimal for regular use, all of which boil down to the following two
    limitations in the end.</p>

<ul>
    <li>It's limited to two dimensions.</li>
    <li>It follows the <code>numpy.matrix</code> interface, rather than <code>numpy.ndarray</code></li>
</ul>

<p>We have designed sparse in order to sidestep these two limitations. Although it isn't as complete as
    <code>scipy.sparse</code>, we are working on it, and hope to make it the de-facto sparse array library for Python.
